# TinyStories Transformer: Small Language Model (20M parameters)
A compact generative Transformer model trained on the TinyStories dataset. This 20-million parameter Small Language Model (SLM) demonstrates basic story generation capabilities while being lightweight enough to run on consumer hardware

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a decoder-only Transformer architecture from scratch in PyTorch, specifically designed for text generation. The model is trained on the [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) dataset - a collection of simple children's stories generated by GPT-3.5/4.

# 📝 Generation Example
    Prompt: "Once upon a time , there was a boy named Sam who loved his red hat . One day :". 
    Generation result: "Sam went to the park with his red hat . He put the hat on and ran around the park . But when Sam got to the park , he realized that his hat was missing ! He started to cry . Sam \' s mom came over and asked , " What \' s wrong , Sam ?" Sam replied , " My hat is gone ! I can \' t find it anywhere ." Mom said , " Don \' t worry , Sam . We can replace it with a new one . Or maybe we can go to the store and get a new one . It \' ll be as good as new !" Sam smiled . He was so happy that his mom had removed his hat to replace his old one . He went to the store and soon forgot about his hat ."

# 📊 Performance Analysis
- ✅ **Grammar & Syntax:** Produces mostly grammatically correct sentences
- ✅ **Style Consistency:** Maintains simple children's story style
- ✅ **Context Following:** Keeps track of characters and basic plot within short sequences
- ✅ **Vocabulary:** Uses appropriate simple language

# 🎯 Conclusion & Recommendations
The 20M parameter TinyStories Transformer successfully demonstrates basic language generation capabilities, producing grammatically coherent short stories with consistent style. The model achieves a validation loss of 1.01 after 19 epochs, showing solid convergence on the dataset.

Key takeaway: While this compact model works well for its size, scaling up to 35-50 million parameters is likely to yield significantly better results in terms of:

- Improved logical consistency and reduced "hallucinations"

- Longer coherent narratives (beyond 200 tokens)

- Better handling of complex sentence structures

- More creative and diverse story generation

# ⚙️ Configuration Setup
To configure the model, you need to create a configuration file: "config.yaml", based on the template: "config.template.yaml"
